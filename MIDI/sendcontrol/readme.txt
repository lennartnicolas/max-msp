# This device links Ableton's send buttons to Max MIDI buttons
# This allows you to enhance the MIDI mapping e.g. setting all sends to zero without having to manually map the sends

# While it seems to be trivial to remap the sends it can be very helpful for live sets and other applications
# Lennart Nicolas Krebs
